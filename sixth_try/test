my body is burning like a flame that is blue, i want some action and i want it from you. 

i admit that in the past i've been a nasty, they wern't kidding when they called me well, a witchbut you'll find that now a days i've mended all myways. repented, seen the light and made a switch; True? yes! and i fortunately know a little magic. it's a talent that i always have posessed. little lady please don't laugh, i use it on behalf, of the miserable, the lonely and the prisque -Pathetic Poor unfortunate souls, in pain, in need. this one moaning to get thinner this one wants to get the girl and do i help them? yes indeed. Those poor unfortunate souls, so sad, so true. they come flocking to my cauldron crying Spells into the piece -do i help them ?  yes i do. Oh, but there is one more thing. we haven't discussed the subject of payment yet. Well i'm not asking much, what i want from you is; Your Voice.
